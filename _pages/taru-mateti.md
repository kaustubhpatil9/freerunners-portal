<p style="padding-left: 60px;">45 Medals and 15 trophies for running, close to 40 prizes for badminton, and many more to come! It is hard to miss out her name in the list of podium finishers in her age category. She gives her mentors a hard time when it comes to preventing her running through injuries; such is her love towards running. Her organization put a huge bill board exemplifying how delicately she has managed her work and life. She perfectly fits into her daughter’s t-shirt, which she used to wear in her 9<sup>th</sup> grade. She and her husband, Chandan, were honoured with the Running Couple award by Hyderabad Runners. If you have not guessed it yet, I am talking about Taru Mateti.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 60px;"><img class="alignnone wp-image-392" src="http://www.freerunners.in/wp-content/uploads/2015/07/2016/03/12091333_1210534495628306_9150133203142092255_o.jpg" alt="12091333_1210534495628306_9150133203142092255_o" width="506" height="753" /></p>
<p style="padding-left: 60px;">As ironic as it may sound, Taru was never as athletic in her early days as she is now. In her words, “<em>I learnt all wrong techniques at a wrong age!”</em> She started playing badminton at the age of 21 only after her marriage to an army officer. She recalls, she started playing only to get rid of boredom since her husband, then Capt. Chandan Kumar had a rather busy schedule. Thereafter, she included brisk walking in her exercise regime wherever the family moved. While she worked in a boarding school in Panchgani when her Chandan was posted to Gauhati, the locals there had started recognizing her as the “walking-lady”. In 2008, she was alarmed by her increased weight. Taru mentions, “<em>Even the most polite people at work had started telling me that I was overweight. My in-laws started telling me that I looked better :)</em><em> I was busy, I had no activity, and I stopped my walks. I took work and home responsibilities as an excuse; but if you really want to find time, you will make time. Eventually I did</em>.” Finally, in 2009, she bought herself a treadmill. After losing about 6 kilos of the 15 she had to lose by walking on the treadmill, she joined a gym. Thus began Taru’s journey again towards fitness.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 60px;">Her loyalty has shifted from badminton to aerobics to now running. There was a competition in her gym: 10 minutes each of running, sun salutations, planks, balancing on one leg, and so on. Taru won all of them except for running. And then in Jan’13 she set her heart on running a 10K in PIM Dec’13. She was confident of her stamina; she used to walk for 2 hours - one of her aerobics sessions went for 3 hours. She had to only drift to a new form of exercise. One fine day she just woke up and ran a 10K on her own. She was confident that if she could do it every alternate weekend, she could comfortably run her dream PIM run. Speed, distance were not concerning variables for her; she ran for fun!</p>
<p style="padding-left: 60px;">In one of her practice runs with Pune Running, she met the runners from The Pune Marathoners Club, who educated her about their running programs. Taru now was curious about their runs wanted to run in an Indian File format. She joined the group without any targets/goals in mind. When her then coach, Michael Francis, asked her about her goals, she replied, “<em>What goals? I only want to do a 10K in PIM</em>”. She was a bit scared when Mike told her that everyone in the group either runs a half marathon or full marathon. Despite everything, Taru started training under Mike with The Pune Marathoners Club. She did her first practice half marathon in Jul’13 before the Hyderabad HM in Aug’13.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 60px;">Taru learnt a great deal after running in a group, which probably would have been difficult if she were running on her own. Some of the initial lessons she learnt were breathing techniques and swinging of arms. Her group members, especially Ram and Unmesh, helped her in improving her form every now and then. Learning from other people’s experiences and their mistakes helped her deal with her own pains. She also got rid of her habit of listening to music while running to the point that she cannot run with music now.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 60px;">Shin splints were quite common for her in her initial days of running. A tumor, a benign one, was suspected in one of her legs as well which gave her a lot of despair, but not enough to stop her. This eventually went away with homeopathy and time; maybe wasn’t even a tumor at all. In one instance, she even took a Combiflam and ran, though the reactions from her mentors were in line with superlative form of unpleasantness. She has absolutely stopped doing that now. Nikhil Latey from OGC was someone she consulted frequently during his Pune trips for some of her persistent pains. She has now included cycling in her regime as well to maintain her aerobic capacity when she is not able to run because of injuries. Injuries have never stopped Taru from having fun. Her current training pattern includes a 10-11K run 2-3 times a week and a long/hill run on weekends. Her goal is to be ready for a half marathon at any given time. She is a part of the “Khul ke Jiyo” Dhakkan Athletes and with Hyderabad Runners whenever she is in Hyd, whom she fondly calls her sasuraal.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 60px;">On her training with Free Runners she acknowledges that she got active monitoring of her form and advice on handling injuries, in addition to a constant motivation to keep her on track and focused. Post that her foot landing has gotten better and she does not over stride or slouch. Today when she runs, some of her group members notice her improved running form! Aside from that she has also picked up yoga, which has been helping her quite a lot to get relief from her injury-related pains. She has many dream runs on her wish list now: The Kaveri Trail for the scenic beauty, Bangalore Ultra 50K for the distance and Leh run for its divinity.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 60px;">Taru does admit that it has been challenging to balance her social gatherings with her non-runner friends after she started running regularly. But she manages it somehow. If she is not able to meet with them for dinners to avoid late nights, she meets with them for lunches. Sunday lunches work the best for her since she is already done with her long runs by then. She has also made a new set of friends through running which makes up for everything. One positive quality that she has developed after running is that she is now more tolerant to caustic comments and manages to ignore them; her patience-level and positivity have gone up further!</p>
<p style="padding-left: 60px;">She is also actively promoting running at her work place. She helps her colleagues to get in touch with the running groups their respective neighbourhoods so that they can get active guidance. As per Taru, “<em>Not everyone will run a 21K or 42K. But if they are able to run a 5K regularly, it still makes a difference.</em>”</p>
<p style="padding-left: 60px;">Update: Since this was published, Taru has completed a 50K Ultra in under six hours at the Pune Ultra Marathon and also a Duathlon besides many other runs across the country. She is also a founder member of the RunforFun club at Cybage Software, where she works as a Delivery Head.</p>
