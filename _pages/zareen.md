Stunner is the synonym for her. She is a head turner for both genders alike. She will astound you with her eight packs. She will blow your mind with an electric smile showing her perpetual happy hormone high. Don’t get carried away by that pretty face since she will rip your butt off with her workouts. The sacred utterance of her fitness: determination, discipline, regularity, moderation, quality over quantity. She does not remember the last time when she did not work out. She breaks hearts when people know that she is a mother of two. Well preserved is an understatement for her, for she is going to be the subject for David Fincher’s next movie, “The Curious Case of <strong>Zareen Siddique Shaikh</strong>”.She has always been an athlete in her young days. She went till district level swimming competitions. Zareen owes her current athletic capability to her involvement in sports in formative years. In her words, “I believe the muscles that are required for running were fully developed in my case since I was an athlete throughout during my school days. Whatever you do at that age goes a long way in life” At the age of 36, when she got pregnant, she put on 23 kilos throughout her pregnancy. To make things more complicated, she had to go through a C-Section in her eighth month. She recalls that even after she delivered, her tummy was so big that she could not see her feet! She had always been on the thinner side. She underwent a severe post natal depression partly because of hormonal changes and partly because of a drastic change in her physical appearance. Moving herself was the only way she could think of to get over it. “In the first 3 or 4 days after delivering, I did not know where the baby was, I did not know how my stitches were doing; I tied myself with a cloth around me and started walking. I comfortably walked for 40 minutes.” Exercise helped her get over her depression.

“Exercise does not get in the way if a woman has a C-section. May be she can avoid crunches since she could run the risk of getting hernia, but not exercising for 5-6 months after pregnancy is the worst thing a woman can do to herself. There are so many other exercises one can do aside from crunches.” Zareen got back to her pre-pregnancy weight within 5 months and she was in a better shape than before after 8 months. Her muscles were tight and toned, as if a difficult pregnancy never happened to her. She has gotten into many professions in her life, such garment business, running tutorial classes and now a post natal personal trainer. Being a post natal trainer is very close to her heart since there were not many people who could help her out when she was going through a difficult phase. She had to figure everything out on her own. Her workouts then were more focused on abs and lower back, ladies’ storehouse of stubborn fat. She did all the tough six-pack workouts which are supposedly for men. “The doctor tells you to be careful, that’s his job. But one needs to judge one’s own fitness thresholds and pain levels and exercise carefully. I don’t think any of the workouts I did had crunches. I got my six packs without crunches.” She followed a routine of 30-40 minutes exercise every day, sometimes even twice a day, without fail, depending on how she fed her baby. After exercise, lactic acid builds up in the body making the milk bitter. One needs to wait for 30 minutes to 1 hour for the lactic acid to dilute. Healthy habits also help; she has never been a junk food person, she does not smoke or drink. She has never been on protein powder diet; our daily diet has enough proteins required for the body. Zareen’s post workout protein shake usually consists of 2 egg whites, half a banana and soya nuggets. 5 months after her pregnancy, she started walking and jogging in Koregaon Park. In one of the eventful mornings, she ran into few runners from Magarpatta, including Utpal; she did a 5K within 30 min and she had no clue. She started running 15K with them every month after that. Till then she was only doing 3-4K in the gym. Her distances were jumping guns, but she never got soreness or pain or injuries. Her fitness training throughout her life helped!

Zareen is gifted, but she is not devoid of issues that stand in her way. As a child, she was detected with vitiligo, a skin discolouring disease. Its treatment left her skin hyper sensitive to UV rays. She cannot get too much exposed to sun since her skin starts bleeding. She has to ensure that her runs finish before 7am or happen in the evening. Many of us would have stopped going out, forget running, if it had happened to us; but Zareen had continued running.In Nov’13, about 8 months after she started running on roads, she got a call from Avinash to run a 50K. Zareen thought it would be fun to do a 39K on her 39th birthday. 39K fun run? Only runners can be this crazy. She continued till 46K, she had to stop because of her skin condition. Interestingly, she ran in a comfortable pace and had a pain free run! She also showed up in the gym the next day for her kick ass workout. She has cut down 13 minutes from her half marathon time (2:08 to 1:55) after joining Free Runners. She believes she has a lot of work to do in pacing herself for the last 5K if she has to improve her time. As of now, she just runs for fun without a strategy; she needs to learn how to guard her pace.

“All these things that you read about running changing your lives are absolutely true. There has been such an immense steep in self confidence for me. It has hit the roof”, comments Zareen on how running has changed her life. She feels strongly for safety issues for women runners. She has to deal with eve teasing even though she runs in a posh locality like Koregaon Park. She has to always stick to routes she knows and cannot explore new routes on her own if she does not have a support. There have been many times when she thought she could plan her own long runs in the evening, but refrained from doing so because of these concerns.

Zareen feels fortunate in a way that her husband does not object her running with men who he does not know. Issues such as these are quite major for married Indian women. Zareen puts forth a very valid point on the dearth of married women in running groups, “How many married women do you see in running groups? Very few. It is because they have to take care of kids. We could have more women runners if men could also share the responsibility of taking care of kids on few mornings and send their wives for a run”.

Zareen feels women specifically have to be very vigilant about their health. Women deplete calcium naturally, especially a lot in pregnancies. “Women should work on their bodies. They should pick up an activity that works for them and get their body definitions in place. It makes a lot of difference to confidence”, says Zareen about women workouts. She herself is quite regular in gym, which she thinks every woman should do since most of the body parts of a woman are anti gravity and it takes weight training to keep them firm. She hits gym twice a week. She makes every minute of that 1.5 hours session count. 5 minutes of warm up, 3-4K run on treadmill at 6 min/Km pace followed by a full body workout. She weaves in her abs workout in between the workouts of other muscle groups. Each of her muscle group workouts consists of 3 sets of at least 12 repetitions each. Even when on vacations, she does not miss her workout. She carries her running shoes everywhere. Sometimes she wakes up earlier than her family and makes that 40 minutes for her exercise. Her fitness mania has seemed to pass on to her next generation already. Her 2 year old toddler copies his mother’s floor exercises with dumbbells. Her teenage daughter has already started copying her mum in all aspects. Zareen feels that the current Indian education system does not leave enough time for kids to practice sports, something that our country needs to start working on soon!

Zareen’s advice for new runners: Listen to your body. Always run with a group and under a trainer, somebody like Jeetu. Running is a very physically demanding sport. By the time you get a hang of your body, you should have someone to guide you. Know the difference between being thin and fit. Being thin is not being fit.
