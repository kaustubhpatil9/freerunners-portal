<p style="padding-left: 60px;">We promote running for fitness. We also support young talented sportspersons playing badminton, tennis, football, etc and help them to succeed at the international level.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 60px;"><img class="alignnone wp-image-346" src="http://www.freerunners.in/wp-content/uploads/2015/07/2015/07/12764436_10208733158153494_4856326248258161553_o.jpg" alt="12764436_10208733158153494_4856326248258161553_o" width="581" height="433" /></p>
<p style="padding-left: 60px;">1. We are from a tribe of runners who have the consistency of a mule, courage of a lion and spirit of a wild stallion.
2. No frills but free, who seek the joy of running. Free of brands, events, accessories/gears etc.
3. We make our own runs/marathons/ultra marathons.
4. We respect effort not pace.
5. We shall spread our knowledge; we shall continue to strive to learn and facilitate learning.
6. We don’t get scared by distances, hills, trails, roads, traffic etc.
7. We worship form.
8. We don’t need support but will always provide support to a fellow runner.
9. Water is a luxury and we do not like to waste it.
10. We understand sweating is good for our body; it cools the heat when we are hot and running!
11. Shoes don’t matter, our feet do.
12. Your shape, size and speed does not intimidate us. Each one of us is unique. We respect that. You should too.
13. We do not play games while running.
14. We respect the people who support us during our runs. We know that we wouldn’t be able to run without their contribution. We thank each one of them during our last loop/lap. You call them volunteers, we call them angels!
15. We don’t gloat about our PBs in public, because we know that we haven’t broken any World record! And there are many faster than us! We are happy for every runner and will not be shy to express our appreciation in public.
16. For us, the standards are the same for any sex. We are not gender biased.
17. We will always encourage everybody to run.
18. We are runners for all seasons and are forged by all the elements of nature.</p>
