<p style="padding-left: 60px;">“<em>How do you want to die?</em>”</p>
<p style="padding-left: 60px;">“<em>I want to keep running and vanish in this thin air in darkness along the sea</em>”</p>
<p style="padding-left: 60px;">There is no mince in words in this reply. Naveen has always been an inspiration for me. It was a privilege for me to have this conversation with him.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 60px;">Running happened to him during his cadet training days in Indian Navy. If they did not run, they had to crawl or duck walk as a punishment, and running seemed the easier way out. With this mindset Naveen completed his cross-country 14km run. Till he was about 25 years of age, he ran just 2-3 km to maintain his fitness levels. Later, when he was posted in Pune, he started doing hill runs in Singhgadwith his course mates who were doing commando training. His first tete-a-tete with long runs was with Airtel Delhi Half Marathon in 2008. When he saw an amputee and an 83 year old man over taking him in between 15-17 km mark, his motivation levels shot up few notches. Henceforth, he started training seriously for runs seriously. Ever since he cut down 5-6 minutes in every half marathon he ran. Gradually and smoothly he progressed from a 2:40 half marathon to now 1:37 half marathon.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 60px;"><img class="alignnone  wp-image-394" src="http://www.freerunners.in/wp-content/uploads/2015/07/2016/03/12247183_10153879573702384_4234811812984172073_n.jpg" alt="12247183_10153879573702384_4234811812984172073_n" width="456" height="456" /></p>
<p style="padding-left: 60px;">Running with the nature is his favorite part of running. He fondly remembers one of the runs in Goa. He was running on the beach and he took a brief break to take a look at the sunrise at the meeting point of river and sea. A fleet of seagulls flew over him making a circle over his head. It was like nature was talking to him.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 60px;">What makes Naveen stand apart from the crowd of many veteran runners is his true submission to the process of running. He had completed a few half marathons, a stage when a person’s mind and body have picked up certain stubborn conditioning; he was told by a very veteran runner about a correction in the form he could make in his hip movements and shoulder posture. In order to do that he had to compromise on his pace and distance and put all his mind in correcting his form. Once he did that, he emerged as a much stronger runner. A big gamut of runners struggles to accept this and cut down the intensity of their trainings in order to improve. Letting that self-esteem down to take corrective actions is easier said than done. He has finished two 50km runs so far. He has gravitated to the role of giving back to the society by starting a running group in his neighborhood. Starting a running group meant compromising his own training, definitely not an easy decision to take. Naveen has been doing this for close to a year now and he has been enjoying the gratification feeling through this journey. Spreading the knowledge of form, breathing, running style is his motto. Rest everything follows once these things are checked off.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 60px;">He took the responsibility of conducting the 1<sup>st</sup> Ultramarathon of Pune in a trail route. <em>“Running events is about runners, not just the events</em>”, is what he said when asked about his focus on conducting this event. He is empowered with a very able team from Free Runners, about whom he speaks very fondly of.</p>
