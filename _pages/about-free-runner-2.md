FreeRunner is the brainchild of a vibrant group of runners who believe in breaking out of the connotations of complexities attached to the commercialization of running. We, at FreeRunners, “uncomplicate” running since that is what running is. It is a simple sport very natural to the human race. Anybody can run provided the runner has the desire to transform for good. On a lighter note, we have broken down running to two simple progressive steps: <em>“<strong>Get up in the morning (GUM)</strong>” and “<strong>Shut up and run (SUAR)</strong>”</em>

Every person who joins us is put under a very structured training program starting from walk and jog phase, progressing through gradually scaled up distances to a continuous half marathon phase. Every runner is given thorough mentoring on correct running form, hydration, breathing and a unique process depending on personal base strength and prior involvements in physical pursuits. People of different ages have joined us from different walks of life and have ended up with a much happier self than before. More balance in family life, better performance in workplace, elevated strength to handle tough situations in life, higher degree of compassion, happier kids at home, and so on are few things we have heard from runners about their lives after they have joined us. Essentially, one of the "side effects" is a positive life-style change.

Training at Free Runners is deemed to be complete after a runner does a half marathon with us under our guidance. We believe that a journey towards a half marathon gives a person enough insight to one’s own self to decide future path.
